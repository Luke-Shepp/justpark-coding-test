Test conditions: 2.30 hours to complete

Please see PDF for tasks to be run

Preferred delivery:
Please invite Jack Wall, Backend Team Lead to have read access to a private github repo (username: j4k). 

Alternatively, if you are not able to share via github please send us a zip with all your project code and dependencies, with documentation of how to run your code and tests. This is not ideal so should only be used if there is a blocker to inviting via github. 

Useful information
